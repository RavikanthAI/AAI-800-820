My final year project based on Object detection 


Abstract-- As cities grow, there is a need for innovative
parking systems to help drivers identify nearby parking
spots. Developed countries have conducted extensive studies
on such systems. Car parking management systems fall into
four categories: counter-based, wired sensor-based, wireless
sensor-based, and image-based. This work describes
developing, implementing, and testing an image-based system
for detecting vacant parking spaces. After detecting edges, we
use edge density and foreground/background pixel ratio to
determine if a car is present in each parking spot.


For many customers, the mere thought of visiting a mall, retail
store, or public venue is enough to induce a low-level sense of
dread. And it's all because of one nagging issue: parking. Finding
an available parking spot can make them feel annoyed during
peak hours. Drivers end up wasting precious time and fuel
aimlessly circling the lots, growing increasingly frustrated as
each passing minute eats into their plans. This parking purgatory
doesn't just make for an unpleasant customer experience - it can
have a tangible impact on a business's bottom line.
After all, if people are spending more money on gas and less time
actually patronizing establishments, that's revenue that's being
lost. And the problem extends far beyond individual companies -
the time and fuel wasted on parking searches contributes to
broader urban traffic congestion, which is an economic and
environmental drain on entire communities.
Compounding the issue is the fact that urban planners and
parking facility managers often lack the real-time data they need
to make informed decisions about managing and optimizing
parking resources. Without a clear picture of utilization rates and
patterns, it's extremely difficult to direct drivers efficiently to
available spots and alleviate the constant search.
The good news is that solutions are emerging to address this
challenge. By leveraging technology to quickly guide drivers to
open parking spaces, cities can not only improve the customer
experience, but also reduce traffic congestion and its associated
costs. This represents a win-win scenario that urban areas should
be prioritizing as they work to create more livable, sustainable
communities.
Ultimately, solving the parking puzzle is about more than just
convenience - it's about supporting local businesses, protecting
the environment, and enhancing the overall quality of life in our
cities. With the right strategies and tools, we can turn parking
from a headache into a seamless part of the customer journey.
