My final year project based on Object detection 


Abstract-- As cities grow, there is a need for innovative
parking systems to help drivers identify nearby parking
spots. Developed countries have conducted extensive studies
on such systems. Car parking management systems fall into
four categories: counter-based, wired sensor-based, wireless
sensor-based, and image-based. This work describes
developing, implementing, and testing an image-based system
for detecting vacant parking spaces. After detecting edges, we
use edge density and foreground/background pixel ratio to
determine if a car is present in each parking spot.
